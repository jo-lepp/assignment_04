"""
payroll_app.py — the weekly payroll, for someone who has never opened a terminal.

Every Friday the office manager at Salt City Coffee exports the week's timesheet
from the point-of-sale system. This page turns it into a paycheck table and the
CSV the online payroll provider imports — without the manager touching pandas.

The app is mostly *assembly*: the roster is loaded from data/, the upload comes
from the page, and one call to `build_payroll` does all the work. What the page
adds is what a manager needs to trust the numbers: totals, a loud warning about
anything the pipeline could not match, the full lineage table, and the download.

Run it:  Run and Debug -> "Streamlit Run: Current File"   (see README Reference #1)
Test it: pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -k app

# --- The page ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# No scaffolding. Every function this page needs already exists in the payroll
# package, and every widget it needs you used in Assignment 03. README Step 8 has
# the exact widgets, keys and labels; the tests in tests/test_pipeline.py -k app
# check them.
